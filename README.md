## Overview
The following data analysis aims to assist the Head of Aviation in minimizing risks while exploring new industries to diversify the company's portfolio. Specifically, the company is interested in acquiring and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises. However, it currently lacks insight into the potential risks associated with aircraft operations.
### Questions to guide the analysis
What defines a low risk aircraft according to the data provided?
Where can we implement strategies in anticipation of risk within the variables in the data?
## Data
The data is from NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters. It contains data on aircraft category, make, total fatal, serious and minor injuries, aircraft damage, broad phase of flight and aircraft conditions.
## Results 
Airplanes are the safest aircraft category.

## Conclusions
This analysis led to four recommendations:
1. The client should go for Cessna airplane model, as it has proven to be the safest with the lowest extent of damage, despite its high prevalence. This indicates that it is resilient and can withstand risks, even though it is the most exposed to them.
2. The plane should have the reciprocating engine, which has the lowest number of fatal injuries, indicating a lower likelihood of engine failures.
3. The client shall consider scheduling flights during VMC weather conditions and implement enhanced safety measures for flights in IMC conditions. This will help manage risk and improve safety during adverse weather scenarios.
4. The team should focus on enforcing additional safety measures during critical flight phases such as 'Cruise,' 'Maneuvering,' 'Takeoff,' and 'Approach.' The client should explore ways to ensure smooth operations during these phases and invest in robust precautionary measures to minimize mishaps.
